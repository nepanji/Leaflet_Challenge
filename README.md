# Leaflet_Challenge

## Overview
This assignment will demonstrate my ability to use a GeoJSON data in javascript to visualize 
global earthquake data through interavtive maps with Leaflet. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to show a visual comparison of the earth's magnitude and depth
for each earthquake.

## Assignment
### Level 1: Basic Visualization
1. Retrieved the earthquake data set
   * Data collected from the USGS GeoJSON Feed page. The dataset used was a JSON representation of the data labeled
    "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days". The URL of this JSON was used to pull in the data for our visualization.

2. Import and Visualize the Data
   * Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.
    * Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes 
       with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
    * Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked are included.
    * A legend was created to provide context for your map data.
    * Complete visualization generated as seen below.
